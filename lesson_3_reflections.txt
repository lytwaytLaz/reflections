1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? - When
I'm collaborating with other people on a project or when I'm working on different machines from
different locations.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-
to-date with your remote repository? - You want to be sure only to pull when you have a working
version, or when you are finished updating your files.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of
another? - Branches are created within a project when one wants to try things out in program for
instance without ruining the master file. - Clones are created when you collaborate with someone on
a project or when you want to be able to work on your project on more than one computer or to work
on you local machine whilst having a copy on GitHub as well. - Forks are GitHub specific versions of
other GitHub projects where the originator does not want you to manipulate there project but let's
you copy it and work on it on your own.
