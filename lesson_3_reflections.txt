1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local? - When I'm collaborating with other people on a
project or when I'm working on different machines from different
locations.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- You want to be sure only to pull when you have a working version, or
when you are finished updating your files.
